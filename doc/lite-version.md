## Lightweight Version

If you have the feeling that the standard version of **exceptions4c** may be
*a bit overkill* for your specific needs, there exists a *lightweight version*,
targeted at small projects and embedded systems. Use it when you just want to
handle error conditions that may occur in your program through a simple yet
powerful exception handling mechanism. It provides the
**core functionality of exceptions4c in less than 200 source lines of code**.
